This repository contains a Python script that allows users of the DMOJ online judge to scrape their profile. By providing their login credentials, the script accesses the userâ€™s account and collects all problems that have been solved (with the status "AC"). For each problem, the script creates a folder in the Documents directory that includes:

- A folder named after the problem.
- A `README.md` file containing the problem description.
- A `solve.extension` file that contains the solution code.

This project is ideal for those who wish to keep an organized record of their programming problem solutions and easily share them on platforms like GitHub.
